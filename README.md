# MovieDB API using ReactJS

This is my version of a movie database using MovieDV API. You can search for a movie and check for all the results associated with it. It's a simple yet powerful project. See details of a specific movie but click the `View Movie Details` link which navigates you to a new page with all the details about that movie. You can then click `Back` button which gets you back to the homepage where you can still see the movies you searched for populating again. If you want to search for a new movie, you must click the red `X` button before typing your new one. Click `Submit` and watch the movies displaying to you. Hope you enjoy.
